# Smart Lost & Found Solution

*Smart Lost & Found Solution* is an AI-powered surveillance system developed to help users find lost items, vehicles, or even people in crowded environments like malls, universities, and public areas. Whether through describing the lost item or uploading an image, the system intelligently scans camera feeds to locate and identify the object in real time.

This project was developed collaboratively by *Mahmoud Hani, **Menna Allah Fawzy, and **Tasbeeh Mamdouh Abdelaziz* as part of our university AI coursework, combining techniques from image processing, optimization, and neural networks.
